Metrics: simply adding up the metrics is probably not a good idea (you assume that they are on the same scale and you lose the information how the two different tasks contribute to it).
Instead I would log both metrics seperately in TB.
If you need to have a combined metric for learning rate adaptation or early stopping, you can still add them up for this, but then make sure that they are both normalized similarly.

For the multihead case, you could also introduce a weight factor between the seg term and the log term here
